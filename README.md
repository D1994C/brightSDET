The project should be pretty easy to run as it is just a maven project.

I have included the correct chromedriver for the version I was testing on (version 111). If your version is different then please update the chromedriver and feel free to include it anywhere on your machine but remember to update the test properties to state where it is.

A PDF of the test cases is included in the root of the project. 

Some functionality is left without methods as I didn't want to spam the live system and if this is mainly a POC.

Also to note Selenium was chosen as it is what I am currently most familiar with but given a longer period of time I would like to experiment with Cucumber to see if that is a more sutiable solution.
